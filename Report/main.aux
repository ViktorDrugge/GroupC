Day 80, the mean of this histogram, represent either March 20 if its a leap year or March 21 if its not a leap year. Note the sharp peak at day 46, representing the 15th of febuary. Dates after the last of July are not included. The histogram consist of 365 bins, one for each day of the year, seen on the x-axis, and, the number of entries on the y-axis. This binning shifts leap years by one day, however the effect is neglectable.\relax }}{4}}
