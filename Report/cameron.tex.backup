 \section{Introduction}
 \label{sec:intro}
 Since the vernal equinox, 21st March is the start of spring according to the planet's orientation,
 it makes sense to look at how the temperature at this date has been distributed across the last
 three hundred years. Since the previous definition of Spring is admittedly somewhat abstact,
 it would be quite fortunate if the 21st March has generally fallen into the appropriate temperature range
 over the time period supplied by the data.
